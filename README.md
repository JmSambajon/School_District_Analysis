# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the School District Analysis
Maria, the chief data scientist for a city school district is asking us to help analyze data on student funding and students' standardized test scores. We helped aggregate the data and showcased trends in school performance to assist the school board and superintendent make decisions on the schools' budgets and priorities. After providing the school board with our findings, we were notified about evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically reading and math grades for Thomas High school 9th graders. We have removed the reading and math scores for Thomas High 9th graders while leaving the rest of the data intact. Here is our findings on the updated analysis.

## Results
- Analysis on a District level

After removing the math and reading scores for Thomas High 9th graders, there was less than a 1% drop on the overall passing rate for the school district. The change is insignificant on a district level and should not influence any decisions by the school board or superintendent.

If anything, the omission of those 9th grade scores gave a slight bump up in the overall passing rate for Thomas High. However, the raise in percentage is less than one percent and is still not a significant change.

- Effects of Replacing Thomas High School Scores

Replacing Thomas High School's 9th grade math and reading scores did not affect any of the other grade's scores within Thomas High school. Thomas High Schools 10th, 11th, and 12th grade scores remained the same.

There was also no affect on scores by school spending, scores by school size, and scores by school type

## Summary
Removing the Thomas High School reading and math scores for the ninth grade proved to have very little affect on our findings. The biggest changes were those small percentage rates differences in the math and reading passing rates mentioned above. If there is any information that should influence school board priorities, it should start with investigating the cause of the academic dishonesty within Thomas High School's 9th grade.
