# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the School District Analysis
Maria, the chief data scientist for a city school district is asking us to help analyze data on student funding and students' standardized test scores. We helped aggregate the data and showcased trends in school performance to assist the schoolboard and superintendent make decisons on the schools' budgets and priorities. After providing the schoolboard with our findings, we were notified about evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically reading and math grades for Thomas High school 9th graders. We have removed the reading and math sccores for Thomas High 9th graders while leaving the rest of the data intact. Here is our findings on the udpated analysis.

If anything, the omission of those 9th grade scores gave a slight bump up in the overall passing rate. However, the raise in percentage is less than one percent and is still not a significant change.

- Effects of Replacing Thomas High School Scores

Replacing Thomas High Shool's 9th grade math and reading scores did not affect any of the other grade's scores within Thomas High school. Thomas High Schools 10th, 11th, and 12th grade scores remained the same.

There was also no affect on scores by school spending, scores by school size, and scores by school typpe

## Summary
Changing the Thomas High School reading and math scores for the ninth grade proved to have very little affect on any level of the analysis. The biggest changes were math, reading, and overall passings rates on the district and shcools level. While those changes may be the biggest, the passing rates changed less than 1%. change and therefore is not significant enough to influence shcoolboard decisions.
